# Curve Forecasting for Day-Ahead Electricity Markets  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains the code for **forecasting demand and supply price/volume curves** in the **day-ahead electricity market**. The approach involves **decomposing the bid curves into structurally significant components (B, M, and E)** and using **statistical models** for forecasting. It contains the code for both the linear and the combined variant of forecasting, as detailed in the submission (ASMB-25-70) "BME Model: Forecasting Electricity Supply and Demand Curves Using a Tokenization Technique".

The models are evaluated using **data from the Italian IPEX Nord bidding zone** and compared against baseline methods.
